    "studyAlphabetTitle": "Summary",
    "studyAlphabetText": "In the Japanese language there are three kind of alphabets:\nHiragana, Katakana and Kanji.\nWe will focus only on Hiragana and Katakana. They are divided into:\n- Monographs which are the base characters;\n- Diacritics, which are the extension for the base characters;\n- Digraphs, which are a union of two syllables;\n- Geminate consoant, which is the use of a small tsu to indicate how to pronunce the word;\n- Long vowels that is the use of a dash representing the pronunciation of the long vowel.",
    "studyHiraganaTitle": "Hiragana",
    "studyHiraganaText1": "The Hiragana alphabet is used to write native Japanese words without representation by kanji or grammatical elements such as particles and inflections, and also to represent reading the kanji known as furigana.\nThe base characters ie the vowels and monographs (gojūon in Japanese) are divided into 46 characters:\n- 5 singular vowels,\n- 40 consonant-vowel union, \n-1 singular consonant. \n\nThe characters will be shown in the tables. Just click on the syllable to show the Kana it represents or click the eye button to show all the Kanas.\nWhen looking at the table, they are divided by columns, each one representing the vowels and the lines, which represent the families.\nFor example, the syllables are KA/KI/KU/KE/KO are from the K family.",
    "studyHiraganaText2": "In addition to the table above, there is an extension which is diacritics (gojūon with dakuten ゛ or handakuten ゜).\nNew phonemes are created by adding these accents. For dakuten, the base characters used are from the K, S, T and H family and for handakuten is the H family only.",
    "studyHiraganaText3": "Another kind of syllables is digraphs. They are a union of a base character with ゃ, ゅ or ょ.\nThese base characters are KI, SHI, CHI, NI, HI, MI, RI, GI, JI , DI, BI or PI.",
    "studyHiraganaText4": "For sound representation of a pause before a consonant, っ is used. These consonants can be a character from the K, S, T, B, P family.\nFor example, the word さっか (sakka - author) has a small pause in the reading of the consonant k, but さか (saka - hill) is read without the pause.\nAn exception happens with the family N. When using the syllables of this family, the ん is used instead do っ and the pronunciation is the same as a geminate consonant.\nFor example, the word みんな (minna - all)",
    "studyKatakanaTitle": "Katakana",
    "studyKatakanaText1": "The Katakana alphabet is used to represent foreign words, names of people and foreign places, onomatopoeias and interjections, scientific and technical terms, transcriptions of Sino-Japanese kanji readings, and some corporate marks.\nThe base characters , that is, vowels and monographs (gojūon in Japanese) are divided into 46 characters:\n- 5 singular vowels,\n- 40 consonant-vowel union, \n-1 singular consonant.",
    "studyKatakanaText2": "In addition to the table above, there is an extension which is diacritics (gojūon with dakuten ゛ or handakuten ゜).\nNew phonemes are created by adding these accents. For dakuten, the base characters used are used are base characters. of the K, S, T and H family and for the handakuten the H family is used only.",
    "studyKatakanaText3": "Another kind of syllables is digraphs. They are a union of a base character with ゃ, ゅ or ょ.\nThese base characters are KI, SHI, CHI, NI, HI, MI, RI, GI, JI , DI, BI or PI.\nIn addition to these, in the Katakana alphabet more variations are included because the foreign words contain sounds not included in the Japanese language, thus extending this table to VU, SU, ZU, TE, DE, FU and U.",
    "studyKatakanaText4": "For sound representation of a rest before a consonant, っ is used. These consonants can be a character from the family K, S, T, B, P.",
    "studyKatakanaText5": "When you use the ー within a word, it means the long vowel. This extension happens both in words written in Hiragana and in Katakana, but this character is only used in words in Katakana, in hiragana it is used ア, イ, ウ, エ and オ.",
    "studyKatakanaText6": "The Katakana alphabet, as it includes more variations due to the fact that foreign words contain sounds not included in the Japanese language, needed variations to supply these sounds through writing. For this, ァ, ィ, ゥ, ェ and ォ creating new digraphs.",
